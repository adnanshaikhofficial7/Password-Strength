🔐 Brute Force Attack vs Dictionary Attack
🚨 Brute Force Attack

A brute force attack is a password-cracking method where the attacker tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.

How it works:
Uses automated tools
Tries all letter/number/symbol combinations

Continues until success
Example:
If the password is abc123, the attacker may try: aaa111 → aaa112 → aaa113 → … → abc123

Characteristics:

Very slow on long passwords
Guaranteed success eventually
Requires high computing power
Strongly affected by password length

Protection:
Use long passwords (12–16+ characters)
Enable account lockout
Use MFA
Add symbols and randomness



📖 Dictionary Attack

A dictionary attack is a smarter attack where the attacker tries passwords from a predefined wordlist of common passwords and dictionary words.

How it works:
Uses lists like:
password
admin
qwerty
welcome123
Much faster than brute force
Exploits human habits

Example guesses: password
password123
adnan123
qwerty2024

Characteristics:

Faster than brute force
Not guaranteed to succeed
Very effective against weak passwords
Targets predictable patterns

Protection:
Avoid dictionary words
Use passphrases with randomness
Add symbols inside words
Use unique passwords
